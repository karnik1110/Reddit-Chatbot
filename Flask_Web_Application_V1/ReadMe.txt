This Homework is created in VSCode.

Modules:
1. Instances - It contains the sqlite DB file where we are storing the login and signup credentials of the new and current users and also the previous chats.

2. Website - It contains two folders:
	a. Static: it contains images folder(logo file is there), and main.css (all the custom css class is there)
	b. templates: it contains four html files such as base.html, home.html, login.html, and signup.html. These templates includes the front end.

3. website folder also has 4 python files where all the backend functionality is written to interact with the chatbot.
		
The trained Model file will get downloaded, once you'll run the code for the first time.



PS: Before running the code, In the terminal --> Go to the main directory "Flask_Web_Application_V1" then run the command 
--> "pip install -r requirements.txt"

I hope everything will work after this!!
		
Thanks!!!!
