# Deep-Learning-Project

**Instructions for Project Code:**

This Homework is created in PyCharm.
** If running in Pycharm:
--> After loading the project in PyCharm you must select Python Interpreter. The steps are as follows: Go To Files -> Project: pythonProject -> Python Interpreter -> Select the interpreter from the dropdown menu. -> Apply -> Ok. (Recommended interpreter "Python 3.9").
--> This code should run without throwing any sort of error other than missing python libraries. All the libraries used for this project are mentioned in "requirement.txt" file.
	
	
** If Running in Spyder:	
--> Go to Tools -> Preferences -> Python Interpreter -> Uncheck "Enable UMR" -> Apply -> OK
--> Now You can run the main.py
	
Modules:
1. Classes - All classes can be found under this directory
2. Functions - Functions will contain all the user defined functions
3. Datasets - Folder will contain all the datasets which once the code will run, the datasets will be downloaded through code under this folder.
4. Main file is calling all the functions
		
PS: Before running the code, In the terminal --> Go to the main directory "Deep_Learning_Reddit_chatbot" then run the command 
--> "pip install -r requirements.txt"

I hope everything will work after this!!
		
Thanks!!!!


**Instructions for Deployment Code:**

This Homework is created in VSCode.

**Modules:**
1. Instances - It contains the sqlite DB file where we are storing the login and signup credentials of the new and current users and also the previous chats.

2. Website - It contains two folders:
	a. Static: it contains images folder(logo file is there), and main.css (all the custom css class is there)
	b. templates: it contains four html files such as base.html, home.html, login.html, and signup.html. These templates includes the front end.

3. website folder also has 4 python files where all the backend functionality is written to interact with the chatbot.
		
The trained Model file will get downloaded, once you'll run the code for the first time.


PS: Before running the code, In the terminal --> Go to the main directory "Flask_Web_Application_V1" then run the command 
--> "pip install -r requirements.txt"

I hope everything will work after this!!
		
Thanks!!!!
