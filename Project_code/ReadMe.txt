This Homework is created in PyCharm.
** If running in Pycharm:
--> After loading the project in PyCharm you must select Python Interpreter. The steps are as follows: Go To Files -> Project: pythonProject -> Python Interpreter -> Select the interpreter from the dropdown menu. -> Apply -> Ok. (Recommended interpreter "Python 3.9").
--> This code should run without throwing any sort of error other than missing python libraries. All the libraries used for this project are mentioned in "requirement.txt" file.
	
	
** If Running in Spyder:	
--> Go to Tools -> Preferences -> Python Interpreter -> Uncheck "Enable UMR" -> Apply -> OK
--> Go to Classes Folder -> Open FourLayerNN.py -> Remove "pythonProject.classes." from the import. It must be like this "from pythonProject.classes.TwoLayerNN import TwoLayer_NN".
--> Now You can run the main.py
	
Modules:
1. Classes - All classes can be found under this directory
2. Functions - Functions will contain all the user defined functions
3. Datasets - Folder will contain all the datasets which once the code will run, the datasets will be downloaded through code under this folder.
4. Main file is calling all the functions
		
PS: Before running the code, In the terminal --> Go to the main directory "Deep_Learning_Reddit_chatbot" then run the command 
--> "pip install -r requirements.txt"

I hope everything will work after this!!
		
Thanks!!!!
